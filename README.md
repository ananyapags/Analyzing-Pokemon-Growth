# Analyzing-Pokemon-Growth

This project was a great way to push my boundaries in Python and get familiar with fundamental Data Science.
The goal was to be able to solve one of my biggest questions about my favorite game: Pokemon. I wanted to use statistics and a minimum of three plots to see which type of Pokemon trains the fastest and which type is the strongest.
For me, this project was a great way to pick up some new skills in Data science. I was able to understand the functionalities of the data manipulation and analysis in the Pandas library, as well as using Data visualization to demo the results of such analysis using the Seaborn Library.
I would say the most exciting part of this project was getting to apply Data Science to my adventures in Pokemon. As I picked up new technology, I saw myself getting closer and closer to the answer to my question. It was also very cool to see what technologies and APIs were already out there to help support me throughout this project.
